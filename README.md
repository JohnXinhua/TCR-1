# Team Code Reference

A Team Code Reference for competitive programming contests. A somewhat up-to-date pdf version may be found [here](http://www.timonknigge.com/competitive-programming/source.pdf).

## TODO

- [x] Reduce memory consumption of Aho-Corasick algorithm (TLE's frequently on large inputs, e.g. [here](http://codeforces.com/contest/633/submission/16359251)).
- [ ] Range Update, Range Query Fenwick tree ([1](https://github.com/niklasb/tcr/blob/master/datenstrukturen/fenwick.cpp)).
- [ ] Rewrite and (more extensively test) the centroid decomposition.
- [ ] Implement Hungarian Algorithm in C++ and compare with MCMF.
- [ ] Intersecting halfspaces ([1](http://acm.math.spbu.ru/~kunyavskiy/notebook/))
- [ ] DP Optimizations: Convex Hull, Quadrangle ([1](https://github.com/niklasb/contest-algos/tree/master/convex_hull), [2](http://wcipeg.com/wiki/Convex_hull_optimization), [3](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8219))
- [ ] Specifically (^): Convex Hull Trick sample code.
- [ ] Investigate `java.awt.geom` (esp. Area class) ([1](http://web.stanford.edu/~liszt90/acm/notebook.html#file10))
- [ ] Link/Cut trees.
