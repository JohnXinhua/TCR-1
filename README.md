# Team Code Reference

A Team Code Reference for competitive programming contests.

## TODO

#### Datastructures
- [ ] Investigate advantages of Sparse Table for the RMQ (over Segment Tree)
- [ ] LCA (either code or a deriviation from RMQ).
- [ ] Suffix Array or Suffix Tree.
- [ ] Ropes
- [ ] Implicit Cartesian Tree
- [ ] Dancing Links
- [ ] Palindromic Tree (Eertree)

#### Graphs and Trees
- [ ] Articulation Points/Bridges
- [ ] Biconnected Components
- [ ] Triconnected Components
- [ ] Strongly Connected Components
- [ ] Heavy Light Decomposition and Centroid Decomposition

#### Flow & Matching
- [ ] Push Relabel
- [ ] Min Cost Max Flow
- [ ] Investigate how to adapt one of the algorithms to support minimum capacity edges
- [ ] Investigate relevancy of 'circulations' (source/sinkless flows)
- [ ] Hopcroft-Karp algorithm
- [ ] Edmond's Blossom Shrinking algorithm
- [ ] Hungarian Algorithm

#### Combinatorics, Math
- [ ] 2-SAT
- [ ] Review the code related to primes, add fast factorization.

#### Geometry
- [ ] Intersecting Halfspaces
- [ ] Review 'basic' geometry code (line intersection checks etc.)
- [ ] Rewrite the convex hull code

#### Misc.
- [ ] Paragraph/writeup about SQRT Decompositions

#### Java    
- [ ] Template    
- [ ] Investigate BigNum/BigDecimal    
- [ ] Investigate `java.awt.geom (esp. Area class)
